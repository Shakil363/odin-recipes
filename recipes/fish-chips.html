    <h2>A classic British-style fish and chips  recipe</h2>
    <p>Fish and chips is a classic dish featuring crispy, battered white fish and golden fries. 
        The fish is coated in a light, bubbly batter, fried until golden, then served with hot, twice-fried 
        chips and optional tartar sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 white fish fillets (like cod, haddock, or pollock)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup cold sparkling water or beer (for extra crispiness)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into thick slices or sticks, about 1 cm thick.</li>
        <li>Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove excess starch (optional but helps with crispiness).</li>
        <li>Drain and pat the potatoes completely dry with a kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot or deep fryer to around 320°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>Fry the potatoes in batches for about 3-4 minutes or until they start to soften and lightly color. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Let the chips cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Gradually add sparkling water (or beer) to the dry ingredients, whisking until the batter is smooth and thick.</li>
        <li>Increase oil temperature to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Pat fish fillets dry, then dip each fillet in batter, allowing any excess to drip</li>
        <li>Fry for 4-5 minutes, or until the batter is golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Increase oil temperature to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Fry the chips again for another 2-3 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.</li>
        <li>Serve the hot, crispy fish with the golden chips on the side. Add malt vinegar, tartar sauce, and a lemon wedge for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>
